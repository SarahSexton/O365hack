###Project Turnout
#### Team Name: Team Turn Out 

Provide useful feedback for any Skype for Business meeting: Worthwhile or Unproductive? 
##### Feedback
Outlook and Skype for Business users endure frustrating conference calls and unproductive All Hands meetings every quarter. The Turn Out Office Add-in easily provides feedback and notes from the comfort of your Outlook Client. It is a quick and painless process that you can do at your convenience in a matter of seconds: Choose: Unproductive or Worthwhile, write any optional Notes for constructive criticism, and Submit. Done. Our playful UI/UX gives users more reason to engage with the add-in. Now you can ask, "How was the turn out?" or say "That meeting had a great turn out!" with numbers and ratings to back you up. Create great opportunities for employees to collaborate, discuss reviews, and gain insight into the feedback with immersive reports. 
##### Activities
Turn Out is designed to increase user productivity, explicitly for Office. This Add-in also helps users keep track of customer management meetings quickly and efficiently. Turn Out accesses data in the user's currently selected Outlook calendar item and connects to web services. We used web standards-based technologies, such as HTML5, JavaScript, CSS3, XML, and REST APIs.
